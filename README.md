The following are programs I worked on for my Machine Learning and Data Mining class.
</br></br>knn: This implementation of k-nearest neighbors was created entirely by myself. It loads in a dataset of housing prices and calcualtes the distance to all of the other points. Finally, points are weighted based on their distance to the point in question. 
</br>logReg: This is an implementation of logistic regression. For this I implemented the gradient calculation for the training of the algorithm.
</br>net: This is an implementation of a neural network. For this we implemented functions for the back propogation of the algorithm to update all the parameters from graident descent
</br>DTreesKMeans: This is an implementation of decision trees on the output of the kmeans algorithm. In this we attempted to reduce the correlation from the output of the kmeans algorithm in order to get more accuracy from the decision trees.
