The following are programs I worked on for my Machine Learning and Data Mining class.
</br></br>knn: This implementation of k-nearest neighbors was created entirely by myself. It loads in a dataset of housing prices and calcualtes the distance to all of the other points. Finally, points are weighted based on their distance to the point in question. 
</br>logReg: This is an implementation of logistic regression. For this I implemented the gradient calculation for the training of the algorithm.
</br>net: This is an implementation of a neural network. For this we implemented functions for the back propogation of the algorithm to update all the parameters from graident descent
